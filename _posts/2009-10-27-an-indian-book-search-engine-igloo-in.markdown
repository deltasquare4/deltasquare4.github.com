While US has got great online book stores like [Amazon Books](http://books.amazon.com), buying a book online and getting a good deal is still a headache in India. I recently came across a decent online Indian Book search engine called [Iglooo.in](http://www.iglooo.in). After using it, I really felt that I got good deals in books than I used to get by manually searching every store. It doesn't support many book stores for now but, it has got potential. It's something I want to see grow into something big. Kudos to the Iglooo team.

**Update (January 2012)**: Okay, so it seems that [Flipkart](http://flipkart.com) has pretty much won the online book market "battle". I directly buy stuff from there now, when I need to. but, now that I have a Kindle 3G, I do most of my reading/shopping from Amazon.
