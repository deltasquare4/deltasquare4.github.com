Just got myself an iPhone 3G yesterday. I have already jailbroken it to try out some interesting applications. I got to say, it's pretty amazing. I just xould not believe that I can get a full-fledged terminal on a smartphone device. (I owned a Windows Mobile PPC prviously). And now I got all sort of development and networking tools installed on my iPhone. :D

Now, thing is, I copied over some music to my iPhone. Some of the songs didn't have proper ID3 tags so, I thought I should edit them. After all these amazing application found on the platform, I was hoping to get an ID3 tag editor. But, unfortunately I didn't. So, I thought why not develop it myself?

I am already learning objective-c programming. So, this will be kind of an excercise for me.

I will be coming with the ID3 editor soon.

**Update**: This application is cancelled. I hope no one was waiting for it.
