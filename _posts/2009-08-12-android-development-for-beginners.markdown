Just started playing with Android SDK 1.5r3 a couple of days ago. I went through some [architecture videos](http://developer.android.com/videos/index.html), [Hello World](http://developer.android.com/guide/tutorials/hello-world.html) and [Notepad](http://developer.android.com/guide/tutorials/notepad/index.html) tutorials. In my opinion, the API is still not mature enough but, it holds much potential. I don't own an Android handset and the emulator doesn't provide all the applications but, I came to know from some blog posts that built-in Apps are pretty basic and they drastically need improvement.

I was planning to develop a series of basic applications (similar to what [AppsAmuck](http://appsamuck.com/) is for iPhone) which could help other newbie Android developers like me to learn things faster. Then, I came across [blog of bakhtiyor](http://bakhtiyor.com/category/30-days-of-android-apps/), who has already made a similar effort. I will go through these applications this weekend and probably add couple of new apps to the list.

Update: I already started a couple of applications but, couldn't get time to complete them. I wish to resume the development as soon as I can.
