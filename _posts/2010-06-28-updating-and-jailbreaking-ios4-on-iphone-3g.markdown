First of all, I have a [previously jailbroken iPhone 3G](../2009/10/04/upgraded-my-iphone-3g-to-os-3-1/) (MB version, jailbroken with PwnageTool) with OS 3.1.2. As the iOS4 upgrade didn't have many things in store for me (iPhone 3G, you see), I wasn't so excited about it. But I finally spared some time to install it on my ([now
spare](http://www.rakshitmenpara.com/blog/2010/06/05/expectations-and-initial-impressions-of-htc-desire/)) iPhone.

As always it happens to me, the PwnageTool 4.01 didn't work for me as expected/described. I got the [famous](http://www.redmondpie.com/fix-1604-1600-itunes-error-during-ios-4.0-custom-firmware-restore/) error 1600/1604 every time I tried to restore the custom firmware. iTunes threw error 1604 after spending a lot of time trying to restore the custom image in Recovery Mode. I also tried DFU mode, but it wouldn't work. I searched the web/forums for similar issue for iPhone 3G. I found many people having it on 3Gs, but unfortunately none for 3G. Anyway, I tried all the suggested solutions for 3Gs without any luck.

After spending approximately 2 hours trying to figure out the issue, I decided to give redsn0w 0.9.5 beta 5 a go as it works differently than PwnageTool. The catch is, I had to upgrade to the new baseband. Anyway, after a couple of retries, it worked. Ultrasn0w unlock works as expected. iOS4 seems slower than 3.1.2 initially, but I'll reserve my opinion till I spend a lot of time with it. Yes, you guessed it. The review is coming. :)
