After yesterday's release of the new [PwnageTool 3.13](http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/202796266/all-aboard-the-update-train), I decided that I should upgrade my iPhone to the new OS 3.1. The problem was, this method of jailbreak doesn't yet support Windows. For patching of OS 3.1 firmware, the Leopard [Hackintosh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh) (Actually, a Hackintosh VM) came in handy. Moved the patched firmware to windows and flashed it using iTunes in traditional way.

The upgrade took about 5 minutes as usual and voila!! I now have OS 3.1 with all my settings and apps restored by iTunes. I had to install the sim unlock (ultrasn0w) and other jailbreak apps again. But, that's fine I guess.

Regarding the major features, home screen customization from iTunes is neat. Makes it easier to organize the app icons. App Genius suggestions are okay. Can't really test Safari's newest fraud protection and anti-phishing filter but, it's supposed to be good. I have to monitor it for couple of days for any
improvements in battery life.

**Update: **Battery life hasn't gone worse, if not improved. I found Anti-phishing filter in safari quite irritating as pages seem to load slower when it is on. App Genius is not what I expected it to be. It does't always give satisfactory results.
