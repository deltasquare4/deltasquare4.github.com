[The change](http://www.rakshitmenpara.com/2010/06/21/the-change-is-coming/) has finally come - for both me and my blog. I am back to freelancing after working at [Infosys](http://www.infosys,com) for two years. The primary reason being lack of time to concentrate on things I wanted. I've learnt a lot of things in my time at Infy and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Leaving it was a toughest decision I had to make till now, but I'm glad that I will be getting more time to work on my ideas now. With this, there begins a new episode of my career.

As for my blog, after so much time spent on my blog's design, I turned out to be a less-than-average designer (not to mention, too much of a critic) and didn't like any of my designs. So, I modified The Theme Foundry's [Traction](http://thethemefoundry.com/traction/) theme a little bit. I will introduce little functional enhancements going forward but, now the website has reached a stable point in terms of look-and-feel.

P.S. - As I have more time on my hands now, I will be posting more on my blog about my experiments with Android, Javascript and more.
