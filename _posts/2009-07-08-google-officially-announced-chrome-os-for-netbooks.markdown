Google announced Chrome OS on [official Google Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html) today. There were many rumors of a Google OS in development. After a long waiting period, Google has made this official. The OS is meant to be light and it is targeted at Netbooks. According to the blog post, it will support both x86 and ARM architectures. Google is planning to make Chrome OS available to consumers in "Second half of 2010".

According to trends, my assumption is Chrome OS will be faster loading OS with offline version of Google Apps Suite and of course, Google Chrome browser. Too bad, we have to wait at least a year for it.
