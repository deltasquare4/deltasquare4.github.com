Today, I saw a news story on [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/30/missed-the-google-wave-beta-weve-got-hands-on/) informing that Google Wave beta started and invites were sent to 100,000 users. I was disappointed to know that I was not one of them. As it turns out, I am. I just got my Google Wave invitation.

First impressions: neat and user friendly. I'll 'collaborate' with some of my friends and post my opinions.

**Update (October 3, 2009)**: After sending out invites to my friends and colleagues, it seems they still haven't received it. According to the note on the invite page - "Invitations will not be sent immediately. We have a lot of stamps to lick.". Well, we understand it Google but, how many days will it take to "lick a lot of stamps", huh??  
**Update (October 9, 2009)**: Google finally sent out invites that I sent a few days back. I still have some invites left. Let me know if you want one.
**Update (January, 2012)**: Google has discontinued this project last year (or the year before that) and open-sourced it. Apache as taken over its development now.
