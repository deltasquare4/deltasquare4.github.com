As you can probably notice, I am not what you can call a "Regular Blogger". Mostly, I am too lazy to write a whole post that's probably not going to be read by anybody.

Anyway, today's different story. It doesn't matter if anybody is going to read it. I just want to remember this day. So, the background story goes like this:

I decided to leave my current job at Infosys about three months ago. I knew what I have to do but, I wasn't sure whether now was the right time. In short, one could say I resigned without having another job or even a concrete plan for future. Until today, I wasn't sure if I wanted to leave the secure job and comfortable life I am living here for greater stress, lesser money and no comfort. As I said, this was the case until today. Today is the day I realized why am I doing this. I am as sure of doing this as one can be.

I still have one and a half month before I set my sails for more adventurous journey. But, as they say, half the battle is won if you are really determined to win it. So, regardless of whether I meet my expectations, I want to remember this day when I won half the battle :)
