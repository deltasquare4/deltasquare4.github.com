I came across a blog post announcing [Release of Simple](http://www.devtopics.com/google-releases-simple-programming-language/), which is a language based on [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC). [Simple google code page](http://code.google.com/p/simple/) (pun intended) has binary distributions available for download for Windows, Linux and Mac. Author has updated it with a couple of sample applications and a bunch of Reference pages in its Wiki. It is well-suited for "non-professional" programmers who want to develop applications on Android. If you ask me, it's a remote possibility. But, it is a good gesture from Google to encourage adaptation of Android.
